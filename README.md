### Notes:

- Survey requires a valid login
- Webpage is ideal for view via a smaller (tablet) window and not optomized for wide (laptop/desktop full screen) or narrow (mobile) screens.
- The webpage was designed to display video (found in the (static foler). The broken code is in the index.html file
